Write a function that: 
Return true if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.

["hello", "Hello"] returns true (All of the letters in string 2 are present in string 1, ignoring the case)
["hello", "hey"] returns false because the string "hello" does not contain a "y"
["Alien", "line"] returns true because all of the letters in "line" are present in "Alien"
